# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression  

This repository focuses on **Linear Regression**, implementing a custom solution using both **the Normal Equation and Gradient Descent**. Additionally, we use **Scikit-Learn** to validate results and compare performance.  

## 📌 Features & Concepts Covered  
✔ Implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch.  
✔ Use of **Normal Equation** and **Gradient Descent** for optimization.  
✔ Evaluation metrics: **R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), L1/L2 Regularization (Lasso/Ridge)**.  
✔ Application of **linear regression** using **Normal Equation** and **Gradient Descent** and **Scikit-Learn** to predict house prices based on **area**.  
✔ Application on **multivariate regression** to predict house prices based on variables like **area and number of bathrooms**.  
✔ Comparison with all models for validation.
